The zip English_lists contains lists of English words used as features for the task of author gender identification.
The zip consists of 12 such lists. All the lists have lowercased words and/or phrases.

The making of each list is described below.
1. function.txt is a list of English function words: conjunctions, adpositions, pronouns (personal, possessive, wh-), determiners, particles, auxiliary verbs and interjections.
The words were extracted from the enTenTen POS-tagged corpus using the SketchEngine concordancer. 
The nouns and pronouns are given in single and plural and all cases (pronouns). The aux. verbs are given in positive and negative (shouldn't) form.

2. hedge_word.txt is a list of hedge words. It is based on the following: Hyland (2005) and Pennebaker (2011).
The list contains single words and phrases (a bit; i guess).
